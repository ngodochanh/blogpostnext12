1
Noah’s life was one that surely changed the age,
When he found the grace of God;
He was not afraid to stand against the world,
So he built the ark of wood.

 	Would you choose to be a living overcomer,
  Be a person not ashamed to be a Jesus lover,
  One who eats the tree of life,
  And drinks the living water?
  Would you choose to be a living overcomer,
  To leave the world and consecrate
  To be today’s age-turner?
  I give myself to You for Your return.

2
Moses was a person who was called by God,
He was meant to turn the age;
He was God’s companion, he was for God’s move,
He was faithful, meek, and sage.

3
Samuel ministered to be a God-pleasing priest,
He was absolute for Him;
Samuel gave himself to be a Nazarite,
Saved from death, the world, and sin.

4
Daniel had companions, and they ate God’s Word,
From the world, they stood apart;
Through a praying spirit were aligned with God,
For His people, God’s own heart.

 	I will choose to be a living overcomer,
  Be a person not ashamed to be a Jesus lover,
  One who eats the tree of life,
  And drinks the living water.
  I will give myself to be an overcomer,
  To see a heav’nly vision,
  Keep my flaming spirit burning!
  I give myself to You, to turn this age.
